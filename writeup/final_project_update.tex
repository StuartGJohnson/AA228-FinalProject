\section*{Update}

The POMDP for mission planning has proceeded as a modification of the RockSample POMDP example from the Julia POMDP universe. The SARSOP solver is being used for grid domains of modest size. A temporary modification of the original problem to reduce computational complexity has been made in code development: instead of uncertainty in the target locations, I have instead begun with uncertainty in the agent location. In any case, the observation space is the grid world or a small multiple of it. While code has just begun working (SARSOP is converging!), I expect progress to accelerate as I refine tools to plot observations, beliefs and other problem specifics.
